# Technical Design Document (TDD) â€” Carbon Emission Monitoring & Reporting System

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview

The system will use a monolithic architecture for the MVP, ensuring simplicity and faster development. It will consist of:

- **Monorepo**: The project will use a monorepo structure managed with Bun workspaces to streamline development and dependency management.
- **Frontend**: React + Bun for UI, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Bun with Express.js for API and business logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
- **Deployment**: Containerized deployment on Coolify (Indonesian VPS).

### 1.3 Component Interaction

- **Frontend**: Sends API requests to the backend for data retrieval, submission, and report generation.
- **Backend**: Handles business logic, authentication, authorization, and database interactions.
- **Database**: Stores user data, emissions data, audit logs, and configurations.

Key entities:

- **Users**: Stores user information, roles, and permissions.
- **Emissions**: Stores emissions data per site.
- **Audit Logs**: Tracks user actions for compliance.
- **Configurations**: Stores admin-defined settings (e.g., units, date formats).
